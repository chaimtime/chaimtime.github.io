For this week's assignment I had to suggest a new technology to make an old task more productive. I chose meeting scheduling.

# The Problem

Meetings are usually the worst part of someone's work day. There was a funny joke that meetings were torture, but zoom meetings while at the office were next level cruelty. For a volunteer organization where there is a need for face-to-face time, planning a meeting is critical. The problem is that working professionals have other obligations and finding time is a challenging task. Previously, you either had to have a meeting to schedule the next year's meeting or you had to call/email and juggle of matrix of responses. None of these worked well.

Planning meetings a year in advance allowed your meeting to be first; however, these meetings were low priority for the volunteers. As reminders were put out, those who had other plans would drop off, reducing the effectiveness of the meeting (Leuzinger & Brannon, 2021)

# The Better Way

The better way is to use a meeting polling service to propose meeting times and let everyone choose their availability. Instead of choosing one date, a person could prioritize with a yes/no/if no choice. This allows many more options, which in turn allows more people to be available. Given this data, a possible second meeting if needed could follow (Shellenbarger & Chicca, 2020). This chnage that we did saw significant more participation, with more people showing up on time, and doing more of their homework. 


# Final Thoughts
Do not be afraid to try different things. Not always will technology win out, but I have learned that if you have a problem, someone else already does. If they do not, there maybe some money in solving it.
