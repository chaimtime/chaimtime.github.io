I Lost 100 Pounds in 6 Months: Help Me Buy a Belt

I need a lot of new clothing, but most importantly I need a belt. I have been taking my drill and making new holes in my current one. At this point, the belt’s excess is flopping around. We are at the point that people are staring at me. 

Six months ago, I could barely secure my belt. I was fastening it to the widest hole. My pants definitely did not fit either, but if I did the correct breathing exercises, I could close the button. Still, I needed to reduce the tension of the belt on the button. The other belt for my jeans broke, so now I was down to one belt. My vanity sized shirts fit, but barely. And yet, despite desperately needing to buy new clothes, I was afraid to do it.


So instead, I went on a six month weight loss journey. As my brother-in-law said, “You just do not want to shop at the big and tall places?”

What I did was something called purposeful eating. I don’t think it is trademarked, but if it is not, I call dibs. I ate a normal meal, at a specified time, and with a purpose. I did not eat standing up, or in a rush, or otherwise distracted. I never ate a normal meal before, but I needed a new belt, and going out to the store sounded too difficult compared to eating a normal meal. 

To accelerate the weight loss, a friend of mine told me to take Psyllium Husk. Psyllium Husk is the main ingredient in the fiber supplement Metamucil. Psyllium Husk fills you up while maintaining your blood sugar levels and preventing spikes. I also reduced my sugar and carbs — not to zero — but within a range that I was able to handle that would not cause me harm. 

The hardest change was removing milk from my coffee. In retrospect, coffee should only be drunk black. 

In the first month I lost 25lbs. I did not even think of checking my clothes. The prom that I was chaperoning came up, and I was invited to go. The suit that I had should fit. I did lose weight. I put it on, and it buttoned! I reached for my trusty belt, and I was two more notches in. The belt was at the 5th hole, as tight as could be. 

The next week, I tried on other belts. Holy vanity sizing batman. I learned something over that week. I really need a belt that fits me. I couldn’t just buy a belt now; I was still losing weight. I was losing 5lbs a week.  I eyed my favorite suit of mine as well as a favorite sweater of mine. This was the goal. By the middle of the summer, they just fit. I had to keep going. What was the goal?

I originally planned to lose 100lbs by Thanksgiving. In July. Just three months, down 55lbs, I made a declaration that If I could lose 100lbs by Thanksgiving, I would want to celebrate. You can’t celebrate with food, so I said, I want to buy that belt. Not just any belt, but something so over the top  that it will have a story to it. Make this purchase an experience. My 40th birthday is 10 days after Thanksgiving, so let this belt purchase be the culminating experience of my journey.
